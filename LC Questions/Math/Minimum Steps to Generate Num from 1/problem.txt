Given an int n. You can use only 2 operations:
    - Multiply by 2
    - integer division by 3 (e.g. 10 / 3 = 3)

Find the minimum number of steps required to generate n from 1.

Examples:
1. Input: 10
Output: 6
Explanation: 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 / 3 * 2
6 steps required, as we have used 5 multiplications by 2, and one division by 3.

2. Input: 3
Output: 7
Explanation: 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 / 3 / 3
7 steps required, as we have used 5 multiplications by 2 and 2 divisions by 3.
