    - Greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes a greedy (optimal) choice at every single step in the solution in the problem.
    - The greedy choice is defined by some rule.
    - Greedy Algorithm Properties (when to use a greedy algorithm to solve a problem)
        - Greedy choice property: A global (or overall) optimal solution can be reached by choosing the optimal choice at every step.
        - Optimal substructure: A problem has an optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the entire problem contains the optimal solutions to the sub-problems.
    - Examples: Fractional Knapsack Problem, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Problem, etc.
