/* Hash tables or hash maps are used to store key-value pairs.

They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered.

Unlike arrays, hash tables are fast for all of the following operations:
    finding values,
    adding new values,
    removing values

Python has Dictionaries. JS has Objects and Maps, Java, Go & Scala have Maps, Ruby has Hashes
