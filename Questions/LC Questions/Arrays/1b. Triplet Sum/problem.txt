Given an array of integers and a sum value, we need to iterate through the array and find all possible triplets that sum to the given value.

For example, consider the array: arr[] = [0, -1, 2, -3, 1]. The given sum is -2. In the given array, the triplets with sum = -2 are [0, -3, 1] and [-1, 2, -3].
