Given the time operation hours of different banks, you have to test whether a transaction is valid or not. 
For a transaction to be valid it has to fall between the operating hours of the bank.

Example 1:
04:20 - 12:30
19:00 - 21:45
14:00 - 17:30
12:30 - 14:00

Test - 11:00 - 17:30
Output - true

Example 2:
10:00 - 11:00
12:00 - 13:00

Test - 10:00 - 13:00
Output - false
