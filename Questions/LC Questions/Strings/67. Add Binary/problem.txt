This question is asked by Apple and Facebook. Given two binary strings (strings containing only 1s and 0s), return their sum (also as a binary string).

Note: Neither binary string will contain leading 0s unless the string itself is 0.

Examples:

1. "100" + "1", return "101"
2. "11" + "1", return "100"
3. "1" + "0", return  "1"

Constraints:
1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
