Write a program that takes number and gives the resulting palindrome (if one exists). 

If it took more than 1,000 iterations (additions) or yield a palindrome that is greater than 4,294,967,295, assume that no palindrome exist for the given number.

Examples:
1. Input: num = 195
Output: 9339

Input: num = 265
Output: 45254

3. Input: num = 196
Output: -1
