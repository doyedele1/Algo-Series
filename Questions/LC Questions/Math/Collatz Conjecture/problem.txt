Given an int n. You can use only 2 operations:
    -  If n is even then you can divide n by 2.
    - If n is odd then you are allowed to perform (3n+1)

Find the minimum number of steps required to reduce n to 1.

Examples:
1. 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1, Output = 5
2. 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1, Output = 6
