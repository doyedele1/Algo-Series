Given an int n. You can use only 2 operations:
    -  If n is even then you can divide n by 2.
    - If n is odd then you are allowed to perform either (n+1) or (n-1).

Find the minimum number of steps required to reduce n to 1.

Examples:
1. Input: n = 15
Output: 5
Explanation: 
    15 is odd 15+1=16    
    16 is even 16/2=8     
    8  is even 8/2=4 
    4  is even 4/2=2     
    2  is even 2/2=1     

2. Input: n = 7
Output: 4
Explanation:
    7->6    
    6->3 
    3->2    
    2->1
