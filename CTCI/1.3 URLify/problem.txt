Write a method to replcae all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional
characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. 

(Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array (or list of chars) so that you can perform this operation in place.)
Likewise, in Python, strings are immutable.

Example:
Input:      "Mr John Smith    ", 13
Output:     "Mr%20John%20Smith"
