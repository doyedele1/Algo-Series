Given an int n. You can use only 2 operations:
    - Multiply by 2
    - integer division by 3 (e.g. 10 / 3 = 3)

Find the minimum sequence required to generate n from 1.

Examples:
1. Input: 10
Output: ****/*
Explanation: 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 / 3 * 2
6 steps required, as we have used 5 multiplications by 2, and one division by 3.

2. Input: 10
Output: ****/**/*

3. Input: 3
Output: ****/*/ or *****//
