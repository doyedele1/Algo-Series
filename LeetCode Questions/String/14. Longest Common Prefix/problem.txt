This question is asked by Microsoft. Given an array of strings, return the longest common prefix that is shared amongst all strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Note: You may assume all strings only contain lowercase alphabetical characters.

Examples:

1. ["colorado", "color", "cold"], return "col"

2. ["a", "b", "c"], return ""

3. ["spot", "spotty", "spotted"], return "spot"

4. ["flower","flow","flight"], return "fl"

5. ["dog","racecar","car"], return ""
