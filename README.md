# Daily Algorithms Series
In order to challenge myself and prepare for technical interviews, I decided to start this drill where I solve data structures & algorithms challenges daily. Questions are asked by top tech companies in the world

## Day 1: Reverse String
This question is asked by Google. Given a string, reverse all of its characters and return the resulting string.

Example: Given the following strings...
```bash
"Cat", return "taC"
"The Daily Byte", return "etyB yliaD ehT"
"civic", return "civic"
```

## Day 2: Valid Palindrome
This question is asked by Facebook. Given a string, return whether or not it forms a palindrome ignoring case and non-alphabetical characters.

Example: Given the following strings...
```bash
"level", return true
"algorithm", return false
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama.", return true
```
## Day 3: Vacuum Cleaner Route
This question is asked by Amazon. Given a string representing the sequence of moves a robot vacuum makes, return whether or not it will return to its original position. The string will only contain ```L```, ```R```, ```U``` and ```D``` characters, representing left, right, up and down respectively.

Example: Given the following strings...
```bash
"LR", return true
"URURD", return false
"RUULLDRD", return true
```

## Day 4: Two Sum
This question is asked by Google. Given an array of integers, return whether or not two numbers sum to a given target, ```k```.

_Note: You may not sum a number with itself._

Example: Given the following arrays of integers...
```bash
"[1, 3, 8, 2], k = 10", return true
"[3, 9, 13, 7], k = 8", return false
"[4, 2, 6, 5, 2], k = 4", return true
```
