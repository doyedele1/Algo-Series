We are given two strings, s and goal.

A shift on s consists of taking string s and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if s = 'abcde', then it will be 'bcdea' after one shift on s. 
Return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

Example: Given the following strings...
1. Input: s = 'abcde', goal = 'cdeab'
Output: true

2. Input: s = 'abcde', goal = 'abced'
Output: false
