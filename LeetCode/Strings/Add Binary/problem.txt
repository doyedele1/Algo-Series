This question is asked by Apple and Facebook. Given two binary strings (strings containing only 1s and 0s), return their sum (also as a binary string).

Note: Neither binary string will contain leading 0s unless the string itself is 0.

Example: Given the following binary strings...

"100" + "1", return "101"
"11" + "1", return "100"
"1" + "0", return  "1"
