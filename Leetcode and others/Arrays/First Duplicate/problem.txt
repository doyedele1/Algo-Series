Given an integer array that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to length of the array, find the first duplicate number 
for which the second occurrence has the minimal index. In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, 
return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other number does. 
If there are no duplicate elements, return -1.

Example: Given the following arrays...

1. Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,3,3]
Output: 1

2. Input: nums = [2,1,3,5,3,2]
Output: 3

3. Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: -1
