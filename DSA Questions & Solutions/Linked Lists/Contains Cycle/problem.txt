This question is asked by Microsoft. Given a linked list containing unique numbers, return whether or not it has a cycle.

Note: A cycle is a circular arrangement (i.e. one node points back to a previous node).

Example: Given the following linked lists...

1->2->3->1 -> true (3 points back to 1)
1->2->3 -> false
1->1 true (1 points to itself)
